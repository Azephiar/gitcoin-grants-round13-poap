### Submision for ðŸŽ¨POAP's For Grants Round 13


![submission preview](https://i.ibb.co/wCSd3Mx/example.png)

This is my submission for ':art:POAP's For Grants Round 13'. The 2 templates are designed following 3 principles: (1) Respect the brand color and guidelines (2) Immediately recognisable as a POAP for a content placement (3) Similar enough to each other to be recognisable as part of the same set.

I'm not sure what the official font of gitcoin is, for this submission I used 'Miriam Libre'.

Any kind of change is possible on request.
